Please note that smoking is not allowed at this property,  so if you need,  please smoke only outdoors. Please note that the max number of guests allowed at the property is 2.About the NeighborhoodHolding a proud reputation as the richest area of Boston,  Beacon Hill is a largely residential neighborhood. Home to graceful brownstone houses (now the city's most exclusive residences) and the gold-domed Massachusetts State House,  this wealthy enclave also houses U.S. senators,  businessmen and their families. A visit to the Nichols House Museum here offers a glimpse of life back in the 19th and early 20th century. The 1804 townhouse still maintains in its possession its original fittings,  furnishings and art. Stroll along Charles Street for delightful vintage shopping or a sumptuous lunch in one of the many charming restaurants here (locals love the Paramount located on 44 Charles Street). Step back into history and walk the Black Heritage Trail to explore the city's historic sites like the 1806 African Meeting House,  the 54th Regiment Memorial and pre-Civil War structures. As one of Boston's oldest communities,  Beacon Hill is a page out of American history. While it retains its past beautifully with red-brick houses,  cobblestone streets and antique stores,  this neighborhood lives very well in the present. Its streets are bike and stroller-friendly (a bonus for young families in the area). Green spaces like the Boston Common offer Beacon Hill residents a chance to relax,  play and enjoy the outdoors. The combination of Beacon Hill's historical past and its lively,  charming present makes it one of the most attractive neighborhoods in Boston.", "long": "", "heading": "750ft2 - Don", "br": "1", "location": null, "price": "1900", "address": "Beacon Hill", "timestamp": "1454950620.0", "discriminatory": ""},

The room is unfurnished and the apartment is a 5-minutes walk from Coolidge Corner. The lease will be for SIX MONTHS: March 1,  2016 -- August 31,  2016. It may be possible to renew the lease for the September 2016 lease year,  though this is not guaranteed. We are looking for someone who is clean,  quiet,  respectful,  and appropriately laid back (i.e.,  no 420/other drugs,  no smokers,  and no hardcore partiers) and who would enjoy joining in on TV/movie nights in the living room and the occasional adult beverage on the terrace (i.e.,  deck overlooking the lovely parking lot out back). \u263aThe ideal roommate is in her late-twenties and either a young professional or graduate student. Undergrads will not be considered (no exceptions,  our landlord does not lease to undergrads).About the apartment: Overall,  the place is very large; we have a living room,  dining room,  eat-in kitchen,  bathroom,  3 bedrooms (with closets),  3 shared storage closets,  and a balcony. Laundry is coin-op in the basement. We get great light in the place most of the day,  so it's super cheerful! The common areas of the apartment are fully furnished. The two roommates staying have been here for between 1 - 4 years.Rent will be $795 per person plus utilities -- heat,  hot water,  electric,  cable/internet -- which range from roughly $60-$130 depending upon the time of year. We tend to keep the heat low in the winter and roommates can choose to pay a little more for electric in the summer months if they wish to use a window unit air conditioner in their bedrooms.The apartment is located within a short walk of the Coolidge Corner and St. Paul Street T stops on the C line,  as well as several B line stops. There is no overnight street parking in Brookline,  so if you have a car you'll have to rent a private space nearby. The neighborhood is generally quiet and safe,  filled with young professionals,  grad students,  and families.Interested? Great! Send us an e-mail with some info about yourself and any questions you might have.

{"lat": "", "description": "(46 Hanson Street,  Somerville), 4BR, 900, We have a room opening up in our 4 bedroom / 2 bathroom apartment from about March 12 - all of May and perhaps the first week or two of June. We can be flexible on dates - if you'd like to move in March 1st that would be fine. There is also a slight chance the room will be available until about September 12th.The apartment includes a washer and dryer in the unit (not coin operated). The kitchen has a dishwasher,  oven,  gas range stove,  and a microwave. There is a living room with a futon as well. Both bathrooms have showers. The apartment is on the 2nd and 3rd floor of a building in Somerville,  about a 15 minute walk from the Harvard T stop,  a 10 minute walk from Inman Square,  and about a 20 minute walk from the Porter T stop. It's a short walk from numerous bars and restaurants and three different grocery stores. The spacious bedroom with a queen-sized bed has an east facing window that lets in lots of sun during the day,  but is not exposed to any streetlights at night. There is storage space available in the basement as well as in crawlspaces off the bedroom.Rent is $900/month plus utilities. Water,  gas,  and wifi tend to be about $30/month/person in the summer,  and a bit more during colder months. There is a parking space on a private dead-end street just outside the apartment available for $20/month. The owner wants to run the normal background check on a subletter and there may be a nominal fee for this. We would expect first and last month's rent upon commitment to move in.About us - three friendly,  clean,  and outgoing young men,  two are in grad school at Harvard,  one is a consultant. The consultant travels most of the week most weeks for work,  so there would normally only be two other people in the apartment. We like to socialize,  but tend to be fairly busy with work and studying during the week.", "long": "", "heading": "187ft2 - Spacious 1 Room furnished sublet in a 4 bed/2ba apartment near Harvard ", "br": "4", "location": null, "price": "900", "address": "46 Hanson Street", "timestamp": "1455369900.0", "discriminatory": ""},

{"lat": "", "description": "), 3BR, 1250, Dear Internet, My roommates and I have an amazing newly refurbished 3 bedroom/2 bath apartment townhouse floor on East Broadway in Southie. Sadly,  I am relocating for work beginning in April and we're looking for someone to take over one of the rooms. The apartment is 1, 110 sq feet and the open room is roughly 10 ft x 12 ft with a huge closet,  great natural light,  and fantastic proximity to my two roommates. For those of you who like clean clothes--we also have our washer and dryer in unit.We all work in some variety of finance with some longer hours but the home vibe is pretty mellow. Weekends are usually spent road-tripping up to Vermont or New Hampshire for some variety of skiing or hangout time and weekdays we try to get some couch chilling in. It's important to note that each week there is at least a 50% chance you will find yourself watching a forgotten Will Farrell movie on the 60 inch surround sound system. It's relatively unavoidable.Extra perks include our super sweet gas fire place which is perfect for when winter decides to stretch through May/June. Similarly important is our equally sweet private porch for when winter finally goes away. Going one direction,  we're less than a 1 minute walk from the beach and a 10 minute walk from Castle Island. If you head the other way,  in about 10 mins you can find yourself at Stats or Lincoln. Public transit is also great and we're one of the first stops on the 7,  9,  10,  and 11 busses which can drop you anywhere downtown in about 10 minutes door to door. If you like any combination of cozy couches,  waterfront proximity,  sweet bars,  easy transit,  and nice guys,  we'd love to meet you.", "long": "", "heading": "1111ft2 - Spacious bedroom sublet in Southie w/ great roommates ", "br": "3", "location": "Boston", "price": "1250", "address": "906 East Broadway", "timestamp": "1454568180.0", "discriminatory": ""},

{"lat": "", "description": ". near Davis Square, 1BR, 1000, Hello fellow craigslister!I'm offering up my sunny room near Davis Square,  which will be unoccupied from May 18th - July 5th. If you will be available during the majority,  but not all of that time (and you're interested),  still reach out. Start and end dates might be flexible.About the room:The room itself gets wonderful sunlight. Decorated with art I've been gifted,  personally made,  and acquired throughout the years. It has a queen-sized bed and huge desk for all working/studying needs. There is a chest of drawers and a closet with hangers (large enough to stand/lie down in) that will all be available to you. The rent includes internet+utilities. There is a garage-overhang,  off-street parking spot available. It would cost a bit more as I would have to find a storage location for my vehicle.About the apartment and roomies:The apartment is a 3 bed/2 bath. It's on the 3rd floor of a building with an elevator and wide hallways. The bathroom is shared with one other roommate and the kitchen and living room are shared amongst all 3 roommates. Your roommates will be two awesome women. One roommate is an elementary school teacher and the other a recent grad who works multiple jobs. Both are incredibly friendly and wonderfully considerate. The apartment has centralized A/C and coin-operated laundry machines in the building. Both the room and the apartment are smoke-free (not 4/20 friendly indoors).The apartment is a 10 minute walk down the Somerville Community Bike Path to the lively Davis Square. The bike path is occupied with people walking their dogs,  parents with their children,  and all-around happy humans. It's a large part of what sold me on the apartment/neighborhood. The apartment's also a 10-12 minute walk from Porter Square.You:Can be male or female. The space is incredibly accepting and welcoming,  and I hope that you are same. You should be considerate,  clean,  and conscientious. If you respect and treat the space like it is your own,  there shouldn't be a problem. =DI'm available for apartment viewings on weekends on some weeknights.
