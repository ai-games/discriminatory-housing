It is actually a dense urban neighborhood with a considerableamount of green space (the Fens). Although the Fenway consists of a large number of college students,  it also contains a significant population of professionals,  young and old. The famous (or infamous) Landsdowne Street,  bordering the Massachusetts Turnpike on the north and Fenway Park on the south,  is home to many of Boston's most popular clubs and watering holes.

{"lat": "", "description": "), 1BR, 1800, Enjoy the splendor of historic Beacon Hill in this one bedroom apartment right on Charles Street. All of Boston is at your fingertips with the Charles/MGH stop on the Red Line of the T only blocks away and the Green Line about a 10 minute walk. Grocery shop at Whole Foods on Cambridge Street,  or try the local establishments: Savenor's,  where Julia Child shopped,  at the top of Charles Street,  or DeLuca's market at the bottom. Boston Common and the Public Garden are only a couple blocks away,  and Charles Street is lined with shops boutique and antique,  along with some of the best restaurants in the city. The entrance to the Esplanade is at the top of Charles Street as well,  ideal for evening strolls along the Charles River.The apartment is on the third floor over an art gallery boasting lots of natural light through large front and rear windows and hardwood floors throughout. Crown moldings,  built-in bookshelves,  and a fireplace with mantle are indicative of the historic nature of the neighborhood while studio lighting,  a large mirror over the fireplace,  and granite in the kitchen provide contemporary accents. Built in 1850,  the building is in excellent condition.Guest AccessThe bedroom has a double bed and dresser with built-in bookshelves. The open floor plan living room/kitchen includes a queen futon,  two chairs,  a coffee table,  and dining table and chairs. The kitchen is stocked with cookware,  servingware,  plates,  glasses,  mugs,  etc.,  and includes refrigerator,  electric stove with hood,  microwave,  and dishwasher.Interaction with GuestsI look forward to welcoming you when you arrive and will be in touch to make arrangements for your arrival. Other than that,  I live about 20 minutes away but I'm available as you need me by cell,  text,  or email.The NeighborhoodBeacon Hill is quintessential Boston. One of the most historic parts of the city,  it is home to some of its most famous residents,  including John Kerry,  who lives just up the hill. Be sure to visit Boston Common and say hello to the ducklings in the Boston Garden. Go grocery shopping at Savenor's,  Julia Child's old haunt. Grab a pint at Cheers,  just around the corner. And enjoy some of the best food in town at Toscano or a laid back brunch at Paramount.Getting AroundParking is difficult on Beacon Hill,  but who would want to drive in Boston anyway? It's a walking city,  and if it's too far a walk,  the public transit is fantastic. The apartment's closest T stop is on the Red Line at Charles/MGH,  but the Boylston and Arlington stops on the Green Line are only a 10 minute walk and the Chinatown stop on the Orange Line is 12 minutes.Other Things to NoteI love Boston and love helping people get to know it. I've lived here nine years now and have a pretty good feel for the place. I'm happy help you plan your visit,  as much or as little as you like.", "long": "", "heading": "600ft2 - Spacious 1BD on Beacon Hill ", "br": "1", "location": "Beacon hill", "price": "1800", "address": "Charles street", "timestamp": "1455105360.0", "discriminatory": ""},

{"lat": "42.378551", "description": "), 2BR, 800, I am a senior (m) about to graduate with my BFA in Painting. I have a beautiful loft in Union Square,  Somerville with an extra room and I'm looking to find a cool roommate. The loft has 14ft ceilings,  10Ft tall windows with a beautiful view,  washer and dryer,  and art gallery in complex,  located in a very cool artists community (which also includes many scientists as we are right near MIT). My loft is fully furnished except the room,  bring a bed etc with you. Unlike most of Somerville there is extensive parking available here with a residents permit and you can rent a dedicated spot for a very reasonable rate here on the property. Heat,  hot water,  trash pick up,  on site management during business hours,  plowing all included in the rent. I do not subscribe to cable TV,  I choose instead to keep it simple and just have internet services in my home. The second room,  which is the roommate bedroom,  is a loft style space and I will work with my new roommate to close it off for more privacy. Other details about this unique place can be discussed in person. As for pets,  I have one kitten and cannot add any additional pets.If you are interested,  please write to me with details about yourself,  how you like to have your home set up,  what you would prefer/dislike in a roommate situation.In the backyard of MIT,  close to Harvard,  ample bike and car parking,  beautiful community outdoor space,  on site art gallery and artists association. Across from Star Market,  Target,  Golds Gym,  quick walk to Lechemere T green line,  Sullivan Sq orange line,  and many buses (CT2 express to Longwood/MassArt/Mass College of Pharmacy,  Harvard Medical) etc). Only 2 miles to the heart of downtown boston,  a few blocks from 93. A 12-15 minute bike ride to BU Boston University Charles River campus.

The room is furnished,  but if you would like to bring your own bedroom furniture,  that should not be a problem.The building is a luxury building which has a fitness room,  laundry in each floor,  community room,  24/7 concierge,  garage,  bike storage,  central AC in each unit,  and literally 10 steps to the red line train/buses! The location is very convenient; 2 whole foods,  Trade Joe's,  post office,  and tons of restaurants and shops. The rent of the 1BR/1BR is $1225 monthly for May and June and $1275 for July and August (the rent increases yearly in July). As for utilities,  your share of the bills is $ 57.07 for Comcast Internet and Cable and $30 for electricity (higher with AC/ heating usage)My roommate and I are looking for someone who likes to keep the place clean and comfortable and who is respectful and friendly. Also,  unfortunately,  I am allergic to cats and dogs so no pets in the apartment please. Moreover,  due to building restrictions,  only one person is allowed to sublease the room and stay in visitors are not allowed either.

With our quickly growing database of video showings,  we're changing the way you find an apartment. Why should you have to go to a broker,  or five brokers,  and go on showing after showing of places that don't appeal to you before you find the one you want? Why should you waste your time on hundreds of photos that all look the same,  and may or may not be of the apartment you would see? We're changing that. With Proper Realty,  you can see each apartment,  the WHOLE apartment,  before you go anywhere.At Proper Realty Group,  instead of just taking a few pictures we bring a high definition video camera to the actual apartment,  and walk through the apartment pointing it at everything you'd look at during a showing. Then we let you watch it from home. Be sure to check out our massive (and still growing) database of video walkthroughs at ProperRG.com. Or,  I can put together a customized list of videos of apartments that would fit your needs,  sort of like a virtual showing of several places you might like. When you've found your perfect apartment,  or narrowed it down to just a few,  THEN you see it in person before filling out an application.Contact me today to have a selection of video showings sent right to your email - you'll see more apartments than you could with a physical showing,  without the hassle. Or,  if you've found the place for you,  let me know and I'll get you inside the actual apartment to see everything in person.Way Chowshow contact infoProper Realty GroupAll information regarding a property for sale,  rental or financing is from sources deemed reliable.
